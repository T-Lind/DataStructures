As the Operations Officer in my NJROTC unit, I faced a challenging situation with one particular cadet who was very disagreeable, emotional, and hard to work with. His behavior caused friction and disrupted our unit's cohesion, and other cadets began to reject him. However, I knew that as a leader, it was my responsibility to find a way to work with him and help him reach his full potential.
I began by taking the time to talk with him and get to know him better. Through our conversations, I discovered that he had a deep love for art. Recognizing this, I found opportunities for him to use his artistic talents in the context of our unit's work, such as designing posters for our events and creating diagrams for our briefings. As he became more engaged and invested in our unit's success, his behavior began to improve, and he became a valuable member of his platoon.
Through this experience, I learned that every individual has unique talents and strengths that can contribute to a team's success. As a leader, it is my responsibility to recognize and nurture those talents, even in those who are difficult to work with. By taking the time to understand and connect with each member of my unit, I can create an environment where everyone feels valued and supported, leading to greater overall success.
Give an example that shows you are an effective team player. (200 words)
As the software lead for team Rogue Resistance 9527 in the FTC Robotics competition last year, I understand the importance of being an effective team player. Before the Austin Metro League championship, a major competition, our team captain was feeling overwhelmed with the tasks that needed to be completed, so I recognized the need for support and stepped up to help him.
I worked closely with the team captain to create a detailed schedule of all the tasks that needed to be completed, ensuring that everyone understood their responsibilities and was working towards the same goals. As a result of this collaboration, we were able to divide the tasks among team members and streamline our preparation process.
By recognizing the needs of my team captain, I was able to provide the necessary support and ensure that Rogue Resistance ran smoothly. This experience taught me that effective followership is essential in achieving team success, and effective communication and collaboration are key to achieving team goals. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed as a leader, and so proactive followership can be incredibly helpful.
In the end, our team's hard work and dedication paid off, and we advanced to the Central Texas Regional Championship. This experience taught me the importance of being an effective team player and how it contributes to team success. I learned that stepping up and providing support to leaders when needed, communicating effectively with team members, and working collaboratively are crucial aspects of being an effective team player.
Global awareness is a crucial component of effective leadership, as it allows leaders to broaden their perspectives, deepen their cultural understanding, and foster empathy for diverse perspectives. Exposure to different cultures, values, and ways of thinking can help leaders gain new perspectives on the world, and enhance their ability to communicate and collaborate across cultural boundaries.
Developing empathy for diverse perspectives and a deeper understanding of the complexities of global leadership can be achieved through experiential learning activities such as team building exercises, cultural immersion experiences, and case studies. By engaging with local communities and organizations, leaders can learn to navigate diverse social and cultural contexts, and develop their capacity for cross-cultural communication and collaboration.
In today's globalized world, effective leaders must possess cross-cultural competence and the ability to lead in a diverse and complex environment. Enhancing global awareness can equip leaders with the skills necessary to lead effectively, create positive change in their organizations and communities, and address the complex challenges of our interconnected world.

As the integration of Artificial Intelligence and robots into the workplace becomes increasingly common, the characteristics required of a leader must also adapt and evolve. In the military, public, and private sectors, the utilization of AI and robots has become more prevalent, and the manner in which leaders interact and engage with these technologies will have a substantial impact on their efficacy and, consequently, the security of the United States.
Adaptability is an important characteristic for leaders in the current technological landscape. As technology progresses, leaders must possess the ability to swiftly comprehend and effectively utilize new technologies to guide their teams. Furthermore, leaders must be able to adapt to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by these technologies, and possess the capability to think creatively and strategically to optimize their utilization. Some technologies, such as Neuralink implants, could completely revolutionize communication between people and enable people to adapt to challenges in the military or civilian life much quicker. However, the security risks they introduce is an important factor for any leader considering such technology to weigh.
Effective communication and collaboration with both human and robotic team members is another crucial characteristic for leaders in this era of AI and robots. With a growing number of tasks becoming automated, leaders must have the ability to delegate responsibilities and tasks effectively to both human and robotic team members, ensuring that all tasks are executed efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, leaders must possess the capability to effectively communicate and train their team members on the usage of new technologies, ensuring that all team members are on the same page when it comes to utilizing these technologies around the globe. I have been able to realize this idea in my NJROTC unit through the implementation of online communication platforms. These have greatly improved our unit’s effectiveness and efficiency compared to old mediums of information exchange, and helped us significantly in our goal of being the best unit in Texas.
Leaders must also possess the ability to think critically and strategically about the ramifications of these technologies on their organizations and society as a whole. As AI and robots become more prevalent in the workplace, leaders must have the foresight to anticipate and address potential ethical or societal implications of these technologies, and work towards ensuring that their organizations are utilizing these technologies in a responsible and ethical manner. In NJROTC, I’ve had the opportunity to learn and implement CDMIS, and to ensure it is used as an effective but ethical tool in our unit. Considering the large amount of personal information it carries, it is very important to keep that data secure and ensure the necessary ethical standards are adhered to.
As a cadet in the NJROTC program, my experiences have provided me with an in-depth understanding of the importance of adaptability, communication and collaboration, and critical thinking in leadership. Through my participation in the program and interaction with the technology used, I have come to appreciate that leaders in the era of AI and robots must possess the ability to swiftly adapt to new technologies, effectively communicate and collaborate with both human and robotic team members, and think critically and strategically about the ramifications of these technologies on their organizations and society. With these skills and abilities, I am confident in my capacity to be an effective leader in the current technological landscape.

The Satirical Anti-Enlightenment Deconstructionist Theory of Gulliver’s Travels.
In the land of Lilliput, the tiny inhabitants were amazed by the sight of a towering figure
lying upon the shore, his enormous limbs bound by cords. This was none other than Lemuel
Gulliver, a ship’s surgeon, who had been cast away on the shores of this strange and miniature
kingdom. As Gulliver came to, he found himself at the mercy of the tiny Lilliputians and was
soon entangled in the political and social turmoil of their society. So begins Gulliver’s Travels, a
satirical work that explores the follies of humanity through the lens of fantastical adventure.
Jonathan Swift uses this adventure in Gulliver’s Travels to deconstruct humanity’s overbearing
hubris and post-enlightenment social and political institutions through the use of satire, allegory
and disillusioned diction, while illustrating the nuance present through acknowledging the
benefits of these values. In doing so, he embraces a more holistic understanding of humanity and
the world around us, so that we may be better equipped to address the pressing issues of our time
and create a more just and equal future.
Upon encountering the Houyhnhnms in Book IV, Gulliver encounters a society that
embodies the Enlightenment value of reason, which was prevalent in England during Swift’s time.
However, the Houyhnhnms take this ideal to its extreme in a satirical manner, resulting in a
society devoid of emotion and lacking in the warmth and compassion that characterizes human
society. Their society is defined by ”austerity and lack,” with no clear purpose (Franklin, 1). Swift
argues that it was not mere logic but a ”supernatural moral law” from God that gave rise to human
society, and that this law should still be followed (Ehrenpreis, 890). As a ”priest in the Church of
England” for more than fifty years, Swift likely formed his opposition to Enlightenment ideals
during his time preaching, during which he reformed the worship to make it more traditional
(Ehrenpreis, 890).
Swift’s position on the Enlightenment ideal of reason is nuanced, as he recognizes that
humans are often driven by emotions that can lead to irrational behavior. In fact, Swift argues that
humans ”pretend to be rational creatures yet they went to war with one another” and ”kill without
reason [or] justification” (Swift, 173-174). While Enlightenment rationality can be appealing,
Swift’s recognition of the sometimes detrimental influence of emotions in human society
represents a conciliatory measure towards the opposing viewpoint. Swift’s position is not a
complete rejection of reason, but rather a recognition of the need to balance reason with emotions
in order to create a better society.
In contrast to the Houyhnhnms, the land of the Yahoos represents a satirical lens on the
baser instincts of humanity and serves as a critique of the English society of Swift’s time. The
Yahoos are ”monsters” who are ”the most filthy, noisome, and deformed animals” and ”have the
most unbounded... appetites in eating” (Swift 173). Swift suggests that humans, like the Yahoos,
are capable of great brutality and viciousness. We ”harbor insults and injuries, brood over them,
wait till a chance offers, then take revenge” (Twain 2). Additionally, we are particularly vicious as
we ”fight...in organized masses” and are able to kill thousands at once (Twain 20). This serves as
a critique of the flaws and vices of English society, and suggests that the Yahoos represent the
worst aspects of human nature. Swift ”fought...the vague tradition” of enlightenment, which in
part caused vicious weapons such as cannons, as they ”do not represent the moral ideal for man”
(Ehrenpreis 889). In this way, he tears down the facade of the glory of logic and reason from both
sides, and supports traditional social institutions.
In this vein, Swift employs satirical absurdity in the behavior and bureaucracy of the
Lilliputians to deconstruct the political institutions of humanity, specifically those in England. For
instance, in Lilliputian society, ”close to eleven thousand persons have suffered death rather than
break their eggs at the smaller end” (Swift 51). While this is clearly an exaggeration, it serves to
highlight the absurdity of wars fought over trivial differences. Similarly, the Lilliputian
government is top-heavy, with even a ”Minister of Private Affairs”, a nod to the bloated
bureaucracy of the English government (Swift 50). Initially portrayed as protagonists in their
struggle against Blefescu, who break their eggs at the wrong end, the Lilliputians are revealed to
be petty and irrational. Gulliver, falsely accused of being a Big-Endian, must ”fight off [the] false
perception” (Yi, 157) and eventually realizes the absurdity of the conflict. The Lilliputian story
serves as an allegory for ”Bolingbroke, the Secretary of State” in England at the time, who
”seized a dozen [journalists]” for voicing disagreement with his party (Ehrenpreis 881-882). In
this way, Swift exposes the laughable nature of political parties and how they manage to keep
people in conflict for the benefit of those in power. Through these critiques, Swift advocates for a
more empathetic and emotionally intelligent political system that serves human nature rather than
suppressing it, a viewpoint that challenges the popular Enlightenment-era governmental systems.
In the modern day, we still struggle with those in power exploiting their constituents through
conflicts with opponents, under the guise of logic. Republicans use dehumanizing, fallacy-ridden
logic to criticize the Democrats, and vice versa. Unfortunately, our innate tribal aspect causes us
to suppress the humanity of those around us - exactly what Swift attempts to dismantle.
Swift also critiques humanity’s excessive pride. In Brobdingnag, Gulliver constantly
struggles to assert his human identity against his miniature size, often being treated as an animal.
This highlights how we humans should not think we are superior to other animals. Swift ”break[s]
ground for [his] satire of humans” (Yi, 159) by the fact a monkey is capable of holding Gulliver
”as a Nurse does a Child she is going to suckle” (Swift, 95). Twain similarly critiques human
superiority, stating that we are ”The Lowest Animal” and that our ”Moral Sense... enables [us] to
do wrong” (Twain, 1). Swift and Twain thus point out how human intellect and reasoning does
not necessarily correspond to moral decency. In fact, our actions often contradict our supposed
rationality, as we are capable of committing horrendous acts. Swift uses these examples to
dismantle our sense of pride and challenge ”humanity’s attempt to give a condescending” opinion
of our fellow animals (Franklin, 3). In doing so, he dismantles this idea of pompous superiority
embedded in the core of our social institutions and promotes a holistic understanding of humanity.
Finally, Swift takes a jab at the industrial and technological complex through the
adventure in Book II and III through very real examples, rather than hyperbolic ones. Gulliver
describes to the giants of Brobdingnag how humanity’s weapons “could sink a ship with a
thousand men aboard.” Naturally, ”The King was horrified [of]... this invention” (Swift, 101). We
have advanced our maths and sciences to the point where we can exterminate all humans through
nuclear weapons with the press of a button, something that no group of people should have
control over. Swift laments that we have become too focused on scientific advancement,
prioritizing it ”over architecture, agriculture, and art” (Swift, 120). This has resulted in a
repressive and uncomfortable social framework.
In Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, he uses satirical elements to deconstruct and critique
Enlightenment-era institutions and ideologies. Through Gulliver’s Travels, Swift offers a scathing
commentary on humanity’s prideful and destructive tendencies, as well as the shortcomings of
political and social systems that prioritize reason and science over empathy and creativity. Swift’s
traditionalist point of view and his criticism of Enlightenment ideals are particularly relevant
today, as we continue to grapple with issues of inequality, environmental degradation, and
political polarization. His work reminds us of the dangers of blindly adhering to systems that
prioritize rationality and technological advancement above all else, and the importance of
recognizing the complexities of human nature and the limitations of our knowledge. As we
navigate the challenges of the modern world, Swift’s insights into the flaws and failures of
Enlightenment-era institutions and ideologies serve as a cautionary tale. By embracing a more
holistic understanding of humanity and the world around us, we may be better equipped to
address the pressing issues of our time and create a more just and equal future.

I will be developing the next generation of robotics. This will involve research, so gaining experience during my undergraduate program will allow me to hit the ground running and begin contributing to the field sooner. Research gives me the ability to apply the knowledge I’ve gained from labs and lectures in the real, dynamic world. It lets me study in a non-abstracted learning environment where the problems I solve have real-world impacts. These innovations embolden my learning and grow my appetite for knowledge. They can also impact the world directly. For example, a new coprocessor for machine learning sparked by research might launch a company that improves the training times of deep neural networks. These impacts drive our world forward and are what excites me about undergraduate research the most.
Building the future is a team sport. Working on research projects increases my communication and contact with peers, something invaluable. Through discussions and hands-on experience with professors, research also allows me to grow my connections with industry experts that can better focus and asses my talents. This helps me take advantage of new, exciting opportunities, and gives me an important element of professional feedback.
I will conduct research into the intersection of robot kinematics, computer vision, and machine learning. Successful design in these areas transform a lifeless and expensive machine into something astounding. The mechanics of robotics is a solved problem, but what’s more difficult is the ability to interpret the robot's surroundings. Research like UC Berkeley’s SpeedFolding technique used to fold laundry is what I’m interested in and want to know more about. In time, robotic assistants will reduce the stress menial chores place on us, and I will be on the team that helps make it happen.

Since an early age I have wanted to make machines helpful to people.  The machines that will be most helpful in the coming years will rely even more heavily on computer science professionals to provide the programming that makes them useful.

I find it fascinating to learn new mathematical concepts and about algorithms that use those concepts.  Computer science gives me the chance to use that knowledge to develop code which animates a piece of machinery, which I find amazing.

My interests in the past few years have been focused on computer vision and machine learning.  I have been engaging in my own computer science-related experiments outside of school and FTC Robotics.  For example, I designed and built an automated parcel delivery robot that used my own computer vision algorithm for navigation.  I also developed an algorithm to use data from a Microsoft Kinect sensor to locate the floor in a room.  Another set of experiments have involved developing pathing algorithms for robotic movements including holonomic and nonholonomic movement systems and a reinforcement learning based maze solver. I’m always learning about something new, from binary search trees to x86 assembly. Despite all the noise in the world, I remain focused on my goals, intensely interested in computer science, and excited for what the future has to offer.

The leadership opportunities provided by my four years in high school Navy Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (NJROTC) have helped me develop leadership and social abilities valuable to the University of Texas. I’m able to relate to and effectively work with people of many different backgrounds, which is very useful in and out of the classroom. I’ve had the chance to demonstrate this as Operations Officer in my NJROTC unit.

I have planned and successfully executed numerous events which required dedication, diligence, and constant communication.  One example was the First Year Orientation for new cadets that involved planning, gathering materials, and staffing team building activities to welcome them into the unit. This event required creating presentations for our different teams, like Unarmed Drill and Academics, handling logistics for a trip down to the Texas Military Forces Museum at Camp Mabry, and more. By all accounts it was a great success in introducing our new cadets to the unit and getting our team off to a great start.

I am also heavily involved with leadership in FTC Robotics. Responsible for leading a group of 15 students throughout the design, construction, programming, and competition of our robot, it has given me a unique experience in leading a technically-focused team. Last year, as a Hardware Lead, I led my department to victory through establishing an environment open to ideas and supportive of unique takes on the robot’s design. This year, I am expanding on that notion to our software team as well, where communication and different approaches to programming is valued. An open mind allows the best ideas to surface, and gives the best chance for success in any endeavor.

The University of Texas at Austin provides a rare opportunity: a world class education in computer science, lots of available research, a great community, and a local computer science market growing by leaps and bounds due to the influx of companies moving into Austin.

By providing me with professional level knowledge through lectures and hands-on labs, UT Austin will give me the technical means to achieve my goals of establishing my own company and changing the world. Attending the University of Texas at Austin also gives me the opportunity to intern with a wide array of companies, giving me a head start into understanding business and developing me as a professional.

UT Austin also has many research opportunities, such as the Freshman Research Initiative, which can jump-start my introduction into more complex computer science and robotics concepts. With resources and talented people to do research with, UT Austin provides a strong matrix to help grow something to transform lives for the benefit of society.

We don’t change the world alone.  The University of Texas at Austin is filled with talented, motivated people, with whom I look forward to forging connections with, mutually exploring and learning with, and establishing relationships to last a lifetime. From my time during university tours and with previous Vista Ridge High School graduates who went to UT Austin, I have found so many good people who will drop everything just to help you out.  That is the kind of environment which forms the people who truly will change the world.


Born with hearing loss, for many years my world was a quiet one, not hearing conversations with others, and missing out on group activities others take for granted.   When I finally received my hearing aids and a new world opened up it was exciting and somewhat frightening.  I had to make a choice:  step into this exciting and frightening noise, make up for lost time, and succeed, or remain in the silence.  I chose to succeed.

A result of this choice is taking the opportunities that come my way. I invest my time and energy in several areas, while appreciating this wonderful noisy world.  One area is my high school’s Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC), giving me a unique perspective. In NJROTC, I have found a caring family and supportive structure to transform me from a quiet, shy, insecure, introverted freshman into a dynamic and effective follower and leader.  I have been pushed day after day outside my comfort zone.  Through hard work, and learning to be loud occasionally, I became a Platoon Commander.

My hearing aid helps me hear better, while being a Platoon Commander taught me to listen.  On the job training taught me to effectively lead twenty cadets through daily activities such as drill, academic lectures, physical training, and community service.  When a cadet is having a difficult time in their life, the last thing they need is someone shouting orders. I have been privileged to earn the confidence and respect of my cadets by respecting them, establishing personal bonds, and showing a sincere interest in their lives.  One result of that confidence is that, in my fourth year of NJROTC, I am now privileged to serve as the Operations Officer and help manage our unit of 120 cadets.

The rattle and clank of a robotics competition certainly is noisy.  Another opportunity I have been fortunate to have is participating in FTC Robotics.  This competition for high school students culminates in various competitions at levels ranging from local to international.  In the four years on my high school team, I’ve gained a significant amount of technical knowledge and practical experience. I’ve been able to work with many different types of people in a more technical environment and lead them successfully. Last year I was the hardware lead for FTC Team 9527 Rogue Resistance.  We faced a substantial challenge:  design and build a suspension mecanum drivetrain in only four short weeks.  Other teams in Texas weren’t up to the task and chose simpler systems with limited capabilities.

By listening to those in my department and using the leadership lessons I learned from NJROTC modified to this different situation, I was able to manage and motivate them effectively.  The path was complex, challenging, and we all put our heart into the effort over long days and longer weeks.  In the end, we persevered to victory on the Winning Alliance in the Central Texas Championship.  We also received a special Innovate Award for the design itself.  The noise of the crowd and my teammates when we won was a beautiful sound.

We all have our difficulties and challenges.  I have been fortunate to have mentors, friends, and family who have supported me.  I look forward to continuing to learn more, and helping others.  Even if all they need is someone to listen.
Throughout my life, I’ve been fortunate enough to establish a support network of the most talented teachers and students I know, and they continue to help me excel. I have many goals, like establishing my own robotics company, being one of the best computer programmers in my field, and making a difference in the world. These amazing people have helped shape my personality so I can accomplish these goals; without them, my life would be left incomplete. From my tours and brother - who is attending the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University - that if I attend Texas A&M University, there will be just as many kind, motivated, intelligent people to help guide my way.

Commander Hamblet (USCG, ret.), my Senior Naval Science Instructor, has been the one to break me out of my shell. Part of being an entrepreneur requires a personality, leadership, and a determination to succeed. He saw my potential and put in hours of work to bring me to where I am today. With a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, he was able to relate with my interests, and gave me the energy and motivation to continue pursuing my interests. Using his hands-off approach, this year he let me take control and lead the NJROTC program, helping me build the intrapersonal skills required for any job or management situation.

In FTC Robotics, I have been able to grow my knowledge of computer science significantly. My three computer science classes provided a baseline, but I’ve learned so many things that just simply wouldn’t be covered in standard computer science classes. From those skills, I’ve created and released an open source mecanum drive pathing library which is being used by over 50 FTC teams in 5 countries, as well as won the silver at the statewide UIL 5A/6A competition.

My educational goal is to secure a PhD in computer science and achieve a high level of understanding in computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, I want to work on cutting-edge research to further grow my knowledge of the industry and prepare me for life in the professional world. Outside of schooling, I plan on creating a consumer robotics company to help people accomplish everyday tasks such as folding laundry or doing the dishes and establishing educational opportunities for high school students to learn more about machine learning and computer vision.

Far before high school, there was someone shaping my life and guiding me to a path of self-achieved success. My father has endowed upon me a sense of never stopping, never giving up, and never settling for less through his example. Despite growing up poor along with six other siblings in a rural town, he worked tirelessly to establish his own small business which helps others protect their ideas. I’ve realized that I can take this launching pad and through Texas A&M University, achieve my goals.

The New Student Orientation for NJROTC has let me prove to myself that I am a leader capable of much more than I originally thought. A two-day orientation filled with introductions, team-building activities, NJROTC team presentations, and a trip to the Texas Military Forces Museum, it was filled with a plethora of events to be executed perfectly for the forty new cadets to the unit.

As the Operations Officer, it was my responsibility to plan the details and execute the entire event. Creating a schedule, training my subordinates, and being on the ground ensuring a successful event, I had a lot of responsibilities. In just two days everything was planned out, materials were prepared, and the unit’s staff was mobilized to help support the task at hand.

Things couldn’t have gone more perfectly. The schedule was executed almost to-the-dot, the cadets enjoyed a fun introduction to the unit, and were excited and motivated for the coming school year. It was long and tiresome, but I proved that I could manage strenuous situations in an excellent manner.

No matter what I do, I can be confident I can be one of the best. I can manage and pursue my goals and achieve them. I can keep control of my life and stay oriented towards those goals. The New Student Orientation was a benchmark at a level many never experience, and the fact I was able to manage the entire unit’s functions successfully gives me the confidence I’ll be prepared for whatever comes my way during college.

Since an early age I have wanted to make machines helpful to people.  The machines that will be most helpful in the coming years will rely even more heavily on computer science professionals to provide the programming that makes them useful.

I find it fascinating to learn new mathematical concepts and about algorithms that use those concepts.  Computer science gives me the chance to use that knowledge to develop code which animates a piece of machinery, which I find amazing.

I’m always learning about something new, from binary search trees to x86 assembly. Despite all the noise in the world, I remain focused on my goals, intensely interested in computer science, and excited for what the future has to offer.

During my time at Carnegie Mellon University, my educational goal is to complete a Doctoral Program in Robotics and achieve a high level of understanding in computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, I want to work on cutting-edge research to further grow my knowledge of the industry and prepare me for life in the professional world. Outside of schooling, I plan on creating a consumer robotics company to help people accomplish everyday tasks such as folding laundry or doing the dishes and establish educational opportunities for high school students to learn more about machine learning and computer vision.

No one succeeds alone. I’ve built a support network of the most talented teachers and students I know, and they constantly push me to new heights.  This support network has helped me accomplish these goals, and I know from my virtual tours - that if I attend Carnegie Mellon University, there will be just as many kind, motivated, intelligent people to help me towards my definition of success.

It is developing connections with these sorts of people which will define a successful college experience for me. I have no doubt of the academic rigor or the preparation for the computer science industry at Carnegie Mellon University; it is the ability to establish connections with others which last a lifetime that will define a successful college experience. Using these connections, I can find business partners, bounce ideas off of people, and innovate to a level one person alone simply cannot. Through these special people at Carnegie Mellon, I can pour my heart into the work.

We all have our difficulties and challenges.  I have been fortunate to have mentors, friends, and family who have supported me.  I look forward to continuing to learn more, and helping others.  Even if all they need is someone to listen.

My earliest memories are of wanting to build machines that help people.  I come from a world in which respect for others is paramount and education is a lifelong endeavor.  My family encourages the pursuit of knowledge and the practical and responsible application of that knowledge, as well as embracing the theoretical and aesthetic.  We have a strong sense of responsibility to use our abilities to help others.

The way I have chosen to help is to develop robotics that will be able to help people with everyday tasks.  To do these tasks, robots need a better understanding of the world they are in to complete those tasks.  I intend to secure my PhD in computer science and become an expert in computer vision to improve this area of computer science.  One day, robots using the algorithms I have developed will clean your home, help your aging family, and more.

Since an early age I have wanted to make machines helpful to people. I find it fascinating to learn new mathematical concepts and about algorithms that use those concepts.

I invest my time and energy in several areas outside of FTC Robotics and NJROTC, while appreciating this wonderful world. During the past year I’ve taken up long-distance running as a passion. There’s nothing quite like finishing seven miles or breaking a previous record. But to me, the journey is just as rewarding. As I run throughout my city, I am enveloped in the beautiful nature. Large rock faces covered in moss surround the trail I run, beautiful waterfalls pour vigorously yet predictably into a stream I cross time and again. It gives a sense of relaxation and wonder and helps me get away from the noise of the world.

I also have developed an interest in Art History, thanks to my AP Art History class. Pieces like Slave Ship by Turner and the Lukasa by the Luba people are fascinating, giving new insights into different ideas, worldviews, and cultures. The amount of time, dedication, and skill that people throughout history have had is incredible, and appreciating that work is the least we can do for them.

I like to help others accomplish their goals.

In our FTC Robotics Club I regularly prepare for and conduct lessons in coding for dozens of people. It is satisfying to help someone understand a difficult concept.

In NJROTC, I have had the chance to encounter many cadets, each with their own unique story, heading, and motivations. Some cadets have not had the chance to develop the core values of honor, courage, and commitment, or understand how to be part of a team. While a Platoon Commander, one cadet was notorious for improper behavior.  He was never on time, never enthusiastic, seldom in uniform, and did not appear to care about his performance in NJROTC.

After two years in other platoons, there he was, assigned to my platoon. Given his record, it would have been easier and permissible to kick him out. Instead, I decided to work with him. I paid attention to his drawings and his love for anime. I helped him work through a touch family situation. We regularly talked about his day and how he was doing.  For years others had taken one look at him and neglected him, but I found a way to get through and support someone struggling, troubled, unique, and talented.  It took time and effort, but I finally earned his respect  and in turn helped him learn to respect himself.  With that respect, he is now doing better in class, and in other areas of his life.

Born with hearing loss, for many years my world was a quiet one, not hearing conversations with others, and missing out on group activities others take for granted.   When I finally received my hearing aids and a new world opened up it was exciting and somewhat frightening.  I had to make a choice:  step into this exciting and frightening noise, make up for lost time, and succeed, or remain in the silence.  I chose to succeed.

A result of this choice is taking the opportunities that come my way. I invest my time and energy in several areas, while appreciating this wonderful noisy world.  One area is my high school’s Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps. Persevering through my hearing loss, I earned the title of Platoon Commander, in charge of effectively leading twenty cadets throughout daily activities. When someone is having a difficult time in their life, the last thing they need is someone shouting orders. I have been privileged to earn the confidence and respect of my cadets by respecting them, establishing personal bonds, and showing a sincere interest in their lives. One result of that confidence is that I am now privileged to serve as the Operations Officer, and help manage the unit of 120 cadets.

We all have our difficulties and challenges.  I have been fortunate to have mentors, friends, and family who have supported me.  I look forward to continuing to learn more, and helping others.  Even if all they need is someone to listen.
